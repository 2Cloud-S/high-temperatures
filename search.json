The goal is to explore the historical temperature range and identify significant weather events, such as the record-breaking heatwave in 2025.\nThe analysis involves fetching decades of hourly data, processing it to find daily maximums, and generating a scatter plot to reveal the annual temperature cycle and its outliers.\n\n\nTechnical Details\n\nData Source: The data is sourced from the NOAA Integrated Surface Database (ISD). It was accessed programmatically using the R programming language.\nTools Used:\n\nR: The primary language for data analysis and visualization.\nQuarto: The publishing system used to create this website from R code and markdown.\nworldmet: The R package used to import the raw hourly weather data from NOAA.\ntidyverse: A collection of R packages, including dplyr for data manipulation and ggplot2 for plotting.\nlubridate: The R package used for easier handling of dates and times."
